TODAY IS MY DAY!

Something good is going to happen to me, through me, and in me today! 

I prosper and I am healthy, even as my soul prospers.
I have a prosperous soul; mind, will and emotions.

I have the mind of Christ. I am quick, I am smart, I am sharp, I am bright, I am focused.
The Master Teacher lives on the inside of me.
He shows me great and mighty things that I do not know. I have the ultimate advantage.
I have an abundance of talent, ability, opportunity, and insight.

God has a plan and a purpose for my life.
He has given me specific talents and abilities to carry out that plan.
I am extremely talented and capable.
I share that ability with my employer, co-workers, and their customers today.
They need what I have to give. And I give them excellence!

I declare today that I am a new creature in Christ Jesus. That which took place in my heart when
I accepted Jesus was my decision, but not my accomplishment. I chose to allow Jesus to take my
old heart and make it new.
